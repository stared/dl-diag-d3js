Deep Learning architecture diagrams - a D3.js library

Typical artificial neural network diagrams in publications are ugly or unreadable. Let's change that!

## Ideas

(We are above ideas-todo unification energy.)

* Networks
  - Typical networks
  - Network parts
  - Small, Colah-like diagrams
* Vis types
  - Abstract blocks
  - 3D cuboids
* Release as:
  - website ()
  - npm package
  - pip-installable Jupyter Notebook-renderable package
* Drawing
* Import architectures from:
  - Keras
  - ONNX (though, won't be it to detailed)
